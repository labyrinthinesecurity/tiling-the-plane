# tiling-the-plane

## Abstract
- We introduce 16 metatiles forming a permutation group of a single permutation with 6 cycles.
- We show that tiling the even lattice with this set is equivalent to tiling the plane with Truchet tiles
- We introduce saturated tilings, which exhibit interesting visual properties for representing data grouped into equivalence classes
- By automated reasoning, we prove that tiling a finite plane to produce a saturated tiling is always satisfiable
- By using the permutation group to compose 90 degree rotations, we introduce the concept of «rotor» that generalizes the process of saturated tiling to random walks
- We provide a self-avoiding random walk based on the rotor function for generating a data representation of arbitrary equivalence classes through controlled patterning (sinuosity)

This method provides a flexible and efficient way to represent arbitrary equivalence classes, offering a fresh rendering for data visualization.
